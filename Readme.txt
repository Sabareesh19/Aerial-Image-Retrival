1) For smooth execution just make sure you traverse to the directory where the code is present and don't forget to change the "currDir"
   in line 18 (currDir = 'S:/IITC/Spring 2018/Geospatitial/assignment3/').

2) Double check you have the null image JPG file present in the same directory. This is for a comparision in my code.

3) Use "python aerial-image.py" command in your bash to execute the code.

4) Type the latitudes and longitudes as instructed in the GUI. Plese wait untill you get the message .....Displaying image.....

5) The resultant image is generated in the same directory under the name "resultant_image"

6) For demo purpose I have commented a co-ordinate. Un-comment it if you don't want to go through typing of co-ordinates.

7) The run time depends on the distance given between the two co-ord. (Few minutes for 37,813 KB)
